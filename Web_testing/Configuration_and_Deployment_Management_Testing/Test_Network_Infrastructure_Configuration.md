$${\color{green}Summary}$$	

Complex network infrastructure can be vulnerable to configuration issues that affect the overall security of the system. Proper configuration management and review are essential to secure web applications and prevent security breaches that could compromise the entire infrastructure.

$${\color{green}Test \space Objectives}$$	

- Review the configuration of applications across the network and identify vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that the frameworks and systems used are secure and not susceptible to known vulnerabilities due to default settings or outdated software.

$${\color{green}How \space to \space Test}$$	

**1.Identifying Vulnerabilities:** Use automated tools for scanning, but having internal information about software versions and configurations is crucial for accurate assessment.

**2.Challenges in Blind Testing:** Remote scans might miss hidden vulnerabilities or components not directly exposed, like authentication systems or databases.

**3.Importance of Internal Information:** Knowing the exact software versions and patches helps identify vulnerabilities accurately and assess risks associated with outdated or unsupported versions.

**4.Administrative Tools and Interfaces:** Review administrative tools since they are common attack targets. Ensure access controls are robust and default credentials are changed.

**5.Access Control:** Verify access control mechanisms are properly set up, and check if external management interfaces are vulnerable, especially when managed by third parties.
