$${\color{green}Summary}$$

Account lockout mechanisms protect against brute force attacks by locking accounts after multiple failed login attempts. A good balance is needed between preventing unauthorized access and not locking out legitimate users. Typical lockouts occur after 3-5 failed attempts, and accounts can be unlocked via time, self-service, or administrator intervention. A weak lockout mechanism can still allow attackers to access accounts, making testing critical.

$${\color{green}Test \space Objectives}$$

- Evaluate the account lockout mechanism’s effectiveness against brute force attacks.
- Assess the unlock mechanism’s resistance to unauthorized unlocking.

# HOW TO TEST #

**1.Lockout Mechanism Testing:**

- Test logins with incorrect passwords incrementally to see when the lockout triggers (e.g., after 3, 4, or 5 attempts).
- Check if the account remains locked over time (e.g., 5, 10, and 15 minutes).
- Evaluate if the lockout automatically resets or requires manual intervention.
- Test CAPTCHA mechanisms for flaws (e.g., predictable challenges, bypass vulnerabilities).

**2.Unlock Mechanism Testing:**

- Test for vulnerabilities in the unlock process, like reusable unlock links or weak secret questions.
- Ensure that unlock mechanisms are properly secured and not exploitable.

$${\color{green}Remediation \space Recommendations}$$

- Implement time-based, self-service, or manual unlock mechanisms based on risk levels.
- Choose appropriate lockout thresholds (typically 5-10 failed attempts).
- Ensure unlock methods do not introduce new vulnerabilities, such as allowing attackers to unlock accounts.
