$${\color{green}Summary}$$	

The goal is to identify if an application reveals valid usernames during the authentication process, which can help an attacker in brute-force or password-guessing attacks.

# HOW TO TEST #

Account Enumeration: Applications may reveal whether a username exists through different error messages when submitting valid or invalid usernames. This can expose a list of valid usernames.

Testing Steps:

1.Valid Credentials Test: Submit a valid username and password, record the response.
Valid Username, Wrong Password: Submit a correct username but an incorrect password and record the error message.
Nonexistent Username: Use an invalid username and note how the application responds.
Look for variations in error messages or response codes that differentiate between valid and invalid usernames.
Methods to Enumerate Users:

Analyzing login error messages.
Checking URL and redirection patterns.
Using URI probing (e.g., 403 Forbidden for existing users, 404 Not Found for nonexistent ones).
Reviewing web page titles or password recovery messages.
Monitoring response times for variations based on valid or invalid users.
Guessing User IDs:
Usernames can often be guessed based on company policies, patterns (sequential numbers, name conventions), or information found through external sources like LDAP or Google searches.

Gray-Box Testing:
Similar to black-box, this involves analyzing the consistency of error messages during authentication attempts.
